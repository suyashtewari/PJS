                <p>Welcome to PJs! We bring you a competitive activity inspired by 20 Questions that incorporates strategy, suspense, and thrilling gameplay. By allowing up 
                    to 8 players to play at once against each other, trying to guess one another's identities, we've created a game that takes the classic to new heights. 
                    The possibilities are endless! Have fun!</p>

                <h2>Gameplay:</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>To start off, a randomly selected person asks a YES/NO question to another member in the party about his/her identity.</li>
                    <li>The member asked answers the question and proceeds to ask a question themselves to any member in the party. This chain of
                    questioning sets the stage for the game.</li>
                    <li>Whenever any player wants, they can guess another player's identity in the PJs interface using clues from the Y/N questions.</li>
                    <li>A pop-up will show saying if you guessed correctly or not. If you guessed someone's identity correctly, they will be eliminated from the game.</li>
                    <li>No one else will know the results of your guess (or the fact that someone guessed in the first place).</li>
                    <li>All players can ask questions throughout the entirety of the game (even if their identity has already been guessed).</li>
                    <li>The objective of the game is to be the last member of the party whose identity has not been discovered.</li>
                    <li>Tip: keep track of who you think has been eliminated and who you think still needs to be discovered!</li>
                </ul>
    
                <!-- <p>To start off, a randomly selected person asks a YES/NO question to another member in the party about his/her identity. The question's recipient answers the question and proceeds to ask a question themselves to any member in the party. 
                    This chain of
                    questioning sets the stage for the game. Whenever any player wants, they can guess another player's identity in the PJs interface using clues from the Y/N questions. A pop-up will show saying if you guessed correctly or not. If you guessed someone's identity correctly, they will be eliminated from the game. All players can ask questions throughout the entirety of the game (even if their identity has already been guessed). No one else will know the results of your guess (or the fact that someone guessed in the first place). The game continues until one player whose
                    identity has not been discovered remains.  The aim
                    of the game is to keep track of who you think has been eliminated and who you think still needs to be discovered! </p> -->

                <h2>Rules:</h2>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>All questions must be answered honestly. If a player does not know the answer to a question posed to them, the questioner
                        is permitted to ask another question.</li>
                    <li>No one can disclose whether or not another player's identity has been guessed.</li>
                    <li>Allying is not permitted. All communication must take place in one group call.</li>
                    <li>Each identity must be a person known by all members of the party.</li>
                    <li>Don't ask questions that pose as multiple questions. (e.g. Is your identity a scientist or an athlete or a movie star or an author?)</li>
                    <li>Your identity must be the most popular alias for your person. (e.g. Pewdiepie is a common name, but some people don't know that his full name is Felix Kjellberg)</li>
